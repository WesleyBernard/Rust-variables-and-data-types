    // Below are the different integer types in rust

    // Length	Signed	Unsigned
    // 8-bit	i8	    u8
    // 16-bit	i16	    u16
    // 32-bit	i32	    u32
    // 64-bit	i64	    u64
    // 128-bit	i128	u128
    // arch	    isize	usize

    // Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses.
    // So an i8 can store numbers from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127.
    // Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

    //These are a few methods that can be used to handle integer overflow

    // Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add
    // Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods
    // Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods
    // Saturate at the valueâ€™s minimum or maximum values with saturating_* methods
